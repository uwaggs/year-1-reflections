# year-1-reflections

In this article, members from the data solutions stream will share details on some of their project and reflect on their experiences

For each IST member
  - list your name, program, and sport you were matched with

describe the projects (that will be in the project list in the onboarding document) that you did, **1 paragraph per project** and include images where possible. Write in plain, non-technical language, and emphasize how you integrated with the other IST stream members (eg coaches, sports science, s&c, etc).

- can talk about the process, the workflow, and then demonstrate the final project
- make sure you ask the other IST member first or run the final draft of your paragraph by the group
- at the end, put a 1 paragraph reflection talking about your overall experience, **what went well, and what you want to improve/do better for next season**
