# Project Overview

**Name:** Krish Bajaj  
**Program:** 3rd Year Computational Mathematics  
**Sport Matched With:** Men's Basketball (MBB)

# Projects Completed

## U Sports Hoops Pro Players Scraper

I built a tool that collects men's basketball players who signed professionally from U Sports Hoops and saves them into an Excel sheet.  
The coaches are currently using this tool. There is still room to improve the interface, and in the future, I plan to add player statistics to make it more helpful.

## U Sports Stats Scraper

I also created a script that tracks current and upcoming games, saving scores and matchups into a live-updating Excel file.  
Though it isn’t actively used yet, it gave me good practice with building a full pipeline that could support team staff if needed.

# Reflection

I enjoyed working on these projects.  
It helped me build skills in data handling and thinking about real-world use cases.  
Next season, I will be working with the Infrastructure team, and I’m looking forward to learning more, building more, and improving my communication throughout the process.
I also hope to continue developing the GUI for the Pro Players tool to make it even more useful for the coaches.
